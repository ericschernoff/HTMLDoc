HTML/HTMLDoc version 0.01
=========================

This module is an Perl OO-interface to the HTMLDOC commandline-tool available
from http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc. It can be used for easily creating
PDF and PS documents from HTML-Documents.

The module tries to be easy to use. It is possible to send the PDF-output
directly to a browser in a web-environment or to save it to a file.

If you use this module in mod_perl-environment, be careful because there are
problems using IPC::Open3 with mod_perl. See the pod for an other way of this
module to generate the PDF without using ICP::Open3.


Example of use:

use HTML::HTMLDoc();
my $htmldoc = new HTML::HTMLDoc();
$htmldoc->set_html_content($html);
my $pdf = $htmldoc->generate_pdf();

# output the generated pdf to a web-browser:
# send the correct header to the client
print "Content-type:application/pdf\n\n";
print $pdf->to_string();

# or save the pdf to file
$pdf->to_file('foo.pdf');
